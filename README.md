## About The Project

</p>

There have been various homebrew appstores throughout the years, however none of them quite fit the expectations I wished for. I decided to create one of my own, built to last with a fully featured API, multiple console support, elegance, and the last place you'll ever need to look for homebrew again.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on enjoying the homebrew, not the hassle of scouring the web only to find dead links, or it doesn't work
* You shouldn't go expecting quality homebrew and all you find is commercial games and outdated homebrew.
* The appstore shouldn't be complicated, simple to use - and just works.

Of course, this isn't perfect either, it was made by two homebrew enthusiasts in their freetime, you may not find your favorite homebrew on here, or encounter scary bugs, but simply make an issue and we will fix it as soon as we can.
